#### To Do

- [ ] Add preset colours next to colour picker
- [x] Add tabs for colours, effects, and configuration - not added content yet
- [ ] Add effects for adressable LEDs
- [ ] Add a way to configure COM port for arduino and LEDs in the program
- [ ] Add command feedback for custom command box
- [ ] Add a help tab with all the commands that can be sent
- [ ] Artnet input for functionality with the Spectrum Lighting Controller
- [x] Make the code simpler and laid out better
- [x] Make serial work over binary - Not needed due to improvements to the arduino code
- [ ] vim keybinds >:)

#### Ideas
These might be added, or might not.

- [ ] Sound reaction?
- [ ] Ability to individually colour leds
